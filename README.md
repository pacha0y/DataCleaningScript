# DataCleaningScript

1. a tidy data set based on the original data set:
  [tidy_data.txt](https://github.com/zezutom/GetAndCleanDataProject/blob/master/tidy_data.txt) and
  [tidy_data.csv](https://github.com/pacha0y/DataCleaningScript/tidy_data.csv)

2. An R script called
  [run_analysis.R](https://github.com/pacha0y/DataCleaningScript/run_analysis.R)
  performes the following functions from the original dataset:
   - Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
   - Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
   - Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
   - Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
   - From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set
     with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


3. [a code book (CodeBook.md)](https://github.com/pacha0y/)
   that describes variables, data and any transformations or work performed to
   clean up the data
